    "{get_step_prefix(W[0], 2)}Okay, starting with the first equation: log₂(2x + y) = log₄(x² + xy + 7y²). Hmm, since the logs have different bases, maybe I can convert them to the same base. Remember that log₄(z) is equal to (log₂z)/(log₂4) which is (log₂z)/2. So the equation becomes log₂(2x + y) = (1/2) log₂(x² + xy +7y²). Let me write that down:\n",
    "\n",
    "{get_step_prefix(W[1], 2)}Alright, I'll focus on the second equation. Let me write down what's given: log₃(3x + y) = log₉(3x² +4xy + Ky²). I know that log base 9 can be expressed as log base 3 squared. So log₉(w) = (log₃w)/2. Therefore, the equation becomes log₃(3x + y) = (1/2) log₃(3x² +4xy + Ky²). Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2 log₃(3x + y) = log₃(3x² +4xy + Ky²). Using logarithm properties, that's log₃((3x + y)^2) = log₃(3x² +4xy + Ky²). So the arguments must be equal: (3x + y)^2 = 3x² +4xy + Ky². Let me expand the left side: 9x² +6xy + y² = 3x² +4xy + Ky². Subtract the right side from the left: (9x² -3x²) + (6xy -4xy) + (y² - Ky²) =0 → 6x² +2xy + (1 - K)y² =0. So 6x² +2xy + (1 - K)y² =0. Hmm, so this equation must hold for the same x and y that satisfy the first equation. So I need to find K such that this holds given the constraints from the first equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "{get_step_prefix(W[0], 3)}So, starting from log₂(2x + y) = (1/2) log₂(x² + xy +7y²). Let me let A = log₂(2x + y), so the equation becomes A = (1/2) log₂(...) which implies 2A = log₂(...) so 2^(2A) = x² + xy +7y². But since A is log₂(2x + y), 2^A = 2x + y. So 2^(2A) is (2x + y)^2. Therefore, (2x + y)^2 = x² + xy +7y². Let me expand the left side: 4x² +4xy + y² = x² + xy +7y². Subtract the right side from the left: 3x² +3xy -6y² =0 → simplifying: divide by 3: x² + xy -2y² =0. So x² +xy -2y² =0. Let me factor this quadratic in x: x² +xy -2y². Let me see: factors of -2y² that add to +y. Hmm, (x + 2y)(x - y) = x² +xy -2y². Yes! So (x + 2y)(x - y) =0. Therefore, either x = -2y or x = y. So possible solutions are x = -2y or x = y. \n",
    "\n",
    "{get_step_prefix(W[0], 4)}So, the first equation gives x = -2y or x = y. Now, but we also need to ensure that the original logarithm arguments are valid. For log₂(2x + y) to be defined, 2x + y >0. Similarly, the argument of log₄ must be positive: x² +xy +7y² >0. Let me check for both cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "{get_step_prefix(W[0], 5)}Now, for validity: If x = -2y, then 2x + y = 2*(-2y) + y = -4y + y = -3y. But log₂(-3y) must be defined, so -3y >0 → y <0. Also, the other log's argument: x² +xy +7y². Plugging x=-2y: (4y²) + (-2y)(y) +7y² =4y² -2y² +7y² =9y². Since y is real, 9y² is always non-negative, but must be positive. Since y≠0 (since x=-2y, if y=0 then x=0, but then 2x+y=0 which is invalid). So y≠0 and y<0. \n",
    "\n",
    "{get_step_prefix(W[1], 3)}Okay, so I have 6x² +2xy + (1 - K)y² =0. But from {W[0]}'s first equation, there might be a relation between x and y that I can substitute here. Let me see what {W[0]} found. She's working on the first equation. Let me check her steps. She arrived at x² +xy -2y² =0, which factors into (x + 2y)(x - y)=0, so x = -2y or x = y. So, these are the possible cases. Therefore, in each case, I can substitute x in terms of y into the equation I have (6x² +2xy + (1 - K)y² =0) and solve for K. Let me do that. Since there are two cases, maybe I should handle them separately. Since {W[0]} is done with the first part, I can proceed with substitution. Let me start with the first case: Case 1: x = -2y. Substitute into my equation: 6*(-2y)^2 +2*(-2y)y + (1 - K)y² =0. Compute each term: 6*(4y²) =24y², 2*(-2y)y =-4y², so total: 24y² -4y² + (1 - K)y² =0 → (24 -4 +1 - K)y² = (21 - K)y² =0. Since y is real and in this case x=-2y, but y can't be zero (as earlier), so y≠0, so the coefficient must be zero: 21 - K =0 → K=21. \n",
    "\n",
    "{get_step_prefix(W[0], 6)}For the case x = y: Substitute into 2x + y = 3x, which must be positive, so 3x >0 → x>0. Also, the other argument: x² +x*x +7x² = x² +x² +7x² =9x²>0, so x≠0. So x>0. So both cases are valid as long as the conditions hold. Now, moving on, since {W[1]} is handling K, perhaps he can proceed. \n",
    "\n",
    "{get_step_prefix(W[1], 4)}For Case 1 (x=-2y): So K=21. Now, moving to Case 2: x=y. Substitute x=y into my equation: 6x² +2x*x + (1 - K)x² =0 → 6x² +2x² + (1 - K)x² = (8 +1 - K)x² = (9 - K)x² =0. Again, x≠0 (since x=y and in this case x must be positive from my earlier validity check). So 9 - K =0 → K=9. Thus, possible K values are 21 and 9. Therefore, the product is 21*9=189. \n",
    "\n",
    "{work_in_progress_others}\n",
    "\n",
    "{get_step_prefix(W[0], 7)}Wait, {W[1]}, let me confirm your calculation for the second case. When x=y, substituting into 6x² +2xy + (1 - K)y²: since x=y, that becomes 6x² +2x² + (1 - K)x² = (6+2+1 - K)x² = (9 - K)x². So yes, so 9 - K =0 ⇒ K=9. So the two K values are 21 and 9, so product is 189. Hmm, but let me double-check the first case. For x = -2y{pivot_message}\n",
